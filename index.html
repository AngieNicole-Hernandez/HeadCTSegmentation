<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Semantic segmentation of the brain is an important prerequisite for diagnosis and treatment planning. We trained and validated a U-Net to identify multiple intracranial structures on CT.</p>
<p>Materials and methods<br />The primary dataset contained 62 normal non-contrast head CTs. Mean patient age was 73.4 years old (range: 27-95). We annotated 11 structures on the axial oblique series. The dataset was split into 40 for training, 10 for validation, and 12 for testing. We reported interobserver variability using multi-rater consensus labels obtained from the test dataset. To ensure that the model learned generalizable features, we further evaluated it on two secondary datasets containing 12 volumes with hydrocephalus and 30 normal volumes from a publicly-available source.</p>
<p>Results<br />Overall Dice coefficient on the primary test dataset was 0.84&plusmn;0.05. Model performance ranged from 0.96&plusmn;0.01 (brainstem and cerebrum) to 0.74&plusmn;0.06 (internal capsule). Dice coefficients were comparable to expert annotations and exceeded that of existing methods. Our model remained robust on external scans and scans with distorted intracranial anatomy. The use of within-network normalization and class weighting facilitated learning of small classes.</p>
<p>Conclusion<br />Automated segmentation of CT neuroanatomy is feasible with a high degree of accuracy. Our model readily quantifies intracranial compartment volumes on scans demonstrating normal pressure hydrocephalus.. When solving an imbalanced multi-class segmentation problem, special adaptations substantially improved performance.</p></font>
