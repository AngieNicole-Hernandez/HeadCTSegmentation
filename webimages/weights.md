Thank you for your interest!
Our work is undergoing peer review by *Radiology AI*. We will upload our model's weights and 3 sample annotations shortly.
For our peer reviewers: the links can be found in our point-by-point reply to the Journal.
To perform a prediction, the "weights.hdf5" file should be placed in the same directory as "z_controlboard.py".
To test the model in its training state, the 3 sample annotations should be placed in the "mask_data" folder.
